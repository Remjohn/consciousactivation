Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research direction, offering new
opportunities for intuitive content transformation while also posing significant challenges for systematic
evaluation. Existing video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided video
editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity, narrow task coverage and incomplete
evaluation metrics. To address the above limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark
suite specifically designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic dimensions, and covering
video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35
subcategories, whose prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol encompassing video
quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity, integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal
large language model-based assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IVEBench in benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing its
ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes. All data and code will be
made publicly available.

Introduction
Video editing, which aims to transform source videos to satisfy user-specified editing requirements, has
emerged as a crucial capability in both creative industries and practical applications. As the field of generative
modeling and multimodal understanding advances [2, 44], Instruction-guided Video Editing (abbreviated as
IVE that edits are directed by natural language instruction) has attracted significant research interest [7].
This paradigm promises intuitive and fine-grained control over video content, unlocking new possibilities for
content creation, entertainment, and human-computer interaction.
Despite rapid progress, current video editing benchmarks still present notable limitations. Existing bench-
marks [33] suffer from three major challenges: i) Insufficient diversity in video sources: The coverage
of semantic categories, scenes, and editing instructions remains limited, constraining the generalizability of
evaluation results [6, 21]. ii) Restricted editing prompts: Editing instructions are often narrowly defined or
lack granularity, failing to reflect the diverse and complex requirements of real-world editing scenarios [38].
iii) Fragile evaluation metrics: Current evaluation protocols are frequently restricted to basic quality
or alignment measures, lacking a comprehensive, multidimensional assessment, especially those leveraging
advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for semantic understanding [6, 33].
Besides, existing benchmarks are primarily designed for video editing methods based on source-target prompts.
However, due to their poor user-friendliness and unclear editing requirements, mainstream video editing methods

have now shifted toward instruction-guided approaches [7], mirroring a similar trend in image editing [3].
Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive benchmark that fully supports IVE.

Figure 1 Overview of our proposed IVEBench. 1) We construct a diverse video corpus consisting of 600 high-quality
source videos systematically organized across 7 semantic dimensions. 2) For source videos, we design carefully crafted
edit prompts, covering 8 major editing task categories with 35 subcategories. 3) We establish a comprehensive
three-dimensional evaluation protocol comprising 12 metrics, enabling human-aligned benchmarking of state-of-the-art
IVE methods.
In this paper, we propose a modern benchmark suite termed IVEBench for IVE assessment, which tackles the
aforementioned challenges through three key innovations: 1) Diverse video corpus: We construct a highly
diverse dataset of 600 source videos, systematically collected and filtered to cover a wide range of topics across
7 semantic dimensions (see Fig. 1). 2) Comprehensive editing prompts: Editing tasks are designed to
cover 8 categories, with prompts generated and refined via Large Language Models (LLMs) and expert review.
3) Robust evaluation metrics: We introduce a three-dimensional evaluation protocol encompassing video
quality, instruction compliance, and video fidelity, incorporating both traditional metrics and MLLM-based
assessments for richer, more objective evaluation.
We systematically demonstrate that our evaluation suite exhibits a high degree of alignment with human
perception across all metrics. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses of mainstream IVE methods,
we provide valuable insights for the field of video editing. We will open-source the code, release the dataset,
and keep track of the latest IVE methods.

Instruction-guided video editing.
In recent years, the rapid advancement of image editing technologies has laid
a solid foundation for video editing tasks. As the demand for understanding and generating higher-dimensional
content increases, research focus has gradually shifted from static image editing to dynamic video editing [41].
Early video editing methods are initially influenced by inversion techniques in the image editing domain
(mainly DDIM Inversion [31]), leading to the development of numerous source-target prompt-based editing
approaches [5, 22, 28]. Although these approaches can accurately preserve object locations and poses during
the inversion process [8, 10, 13], they are inherently limited when it comes to editing tasks involving subject
movement or camera motion [15, 45]. Furthermore, rather than providing detailed target prompts, users tend
to express their editing requirements through instructions [7]. Given these limitations, IVE methods have
gained burgeoning attention in the industry due to their greater user-friendliness and adaptability to diverse
editing needs [7]. Mainstream approaches typically combine InstructPix2Pix [3] for first-frame editing and then
leverage generative models to propagate the modifications across the entire video [17, 18, 25]. To overcome the
quality bottleneck in such pipelines, Ditto [1] further introduces a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline,
leveraging high-quality image editors and in-context video generators to construct massive high-fidelity editing
pairs. In contrast to these paradigms, InsV2V [7] retrains the model on synthetic triplets of input video, editing
instruction, and target video, enabling direct learning of instruction-driven video modification for consistent
long video editing. Building on this, InsViE-1M [42] further adopts multi-stage training on CogVideoX-2B [44]

and supports static video editing tasks involving camera motion. Lucy-Edit [36] employs a rectified-flow
framework with channel concatenation to achieve high-fidelity editing without requiring masks or auxiliary
inputs. Subsequently, ICVE [24] introduces a low-cost pretraining strategy leveraging in-context learning from
unpaired video clips to learn general editing concepts. Recently, there is a growing trend towards unifying
video understanding, generation, and editing within a single framework by integrating MLLMs with Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Omni-Video [35] and UniVideo [40] propose dual-stream or unified architectures where
the MLLM handles complex multimodal instruction understanding and guides the DiT for consistent video
generation and editing. Based on this, InstructX [27] further utilizing mixed image-video training to transfer
robust editing capabilities to the video domain.
Video editing benchmarks.
With the introduction of benchmarks such as VBench [11] and T2V-CompBench [32],
the evaluation systems in the field of video generation have become increasingly comprehensive. Concurrently,
video editing has also garnered significant attention, leading to the recent emergence of dedicated benchmarks
for text-driven video editing. Among them, VE-Bench [33] and EditBoard [6] introduce dedicated datasets
and evaluation systems for text-driven video editing, partially covering editing tasks of subject, style and
attribute editing. Building on these foundations, FiVE [21] and TDVE-Assessor [38] further push evaluation by
proposing MLLM-based metrics that enhance the objectivity of evaluation. However, a significant limitation
of these existing benchmarks is that they are designed to support source-target prompt-based editing methods,
while offering no or only partial support for IVE methods [6, 33]. Furthermore, these benchmarks are
constrained by limited dataset sizes, narrow content coverage, and include only a small subset of editing
task types [21, 38]. To address these issues, we propose IVEBench, a thorough benchmark suite specifically
designed for IVE methods.

IVEBENCH Database
3.1
Diverse Video Collection for IVE
Video data source. To ensure the comprehensiveness of our benchmark for video editing evaluation, we first
expand the semantic coverage of source videos. Specifically, we define seven semantic dimensions and further
subdivide each dimension into multiple fine-grained topics, resulting in a total of 30 topics. These subdivisions
form a diverse set of semantic requirements for source videos, as illustrated in Fig. 3 (b). Based on these
requirements, we manually collect high-quality video samples (≥2K) on Pexels [12] and Mixkit [34], as well
as some from open-source UltraVideo [43]. In addition, we incorporate a subset from OpenHumanVid [20]
dataset to further enhance the quantity and diversity of human-centric videos (see Fig. 2).
Hybrid automated and manual filtering. All candidate videos undergo a two-stage processing pipeline. In
the automatic preprocessing stage, black borders, subtitles, and low-quality content are removed. Subsequently,
during the manual screening stage, we further ensure that the video content is suitable for editing and capable
of covering a wide spectrum of tasks ranging from simple to complex. Ultimately, we construct a source
video dataset comprising 600 videos with comprehensive semantic coverage, high resolution, and varied frame
lengths. The dataset is organized into two subsets according to frame count: i) the short subset contains
400 videos ranging from 32 to 128 frames. ii) the long subset includes 200 videos ranging from 129 to 1,024

Structural video caption. After obtaining the high-quality source videos, we employ Qwen2.5-VL-72B [2] to
generate captions of appropriate length for each video, capturing key aspects such as subjects, backgrounds,
subject actions, emotional atmosphere, visual styles, as well as camera perspectives and movements. These
annotated attributes are designed to form a structured vocabulary of editable elements, establishing a robust
foundation for subsequent user-driven modification requests.
3.2
Comprehensive IVE Prompt Generation
Diversified editing objectives. To ensure comprehensive coverage of task types in our benchmark for video
editing evaluation, we categorize the editing prompts into eight major classes. Each of these main categories is
further subdivided into more fine-grained subcategories, resulting in a total of 35 subcategories, as illustrated
in Fig. 3 (a). Together, these eight categories encompass the full range of current requirements for IVE tasks
and effectively address the limitations of existing benchmarks in terms of task coverage.
LLM-assisted prompt generation and selection.
For each source video, we employ Doubao-1.5-pro [30], together with previously obtained detailed captions,
to automatically select the most suitable editing category and generate a corresponding editing prompt. In
addition, the system simultaneously produces the associated target prompt and target phrase, which serve as
references for subsequent evaluation metrics. This design ensures that our benchmark can also accommodate
text-driven video editing methods. All editing categories and prompts are further manually reviewed and
refined to guarantee balanced category distribution as well as clear and reasonable prompts.

Comprehensive Metrics of IVEBENCH
In the context of IVE tasks, we define a video editing instance as comprising three data elements: the source
video, the edit prompt (i.e., the editing instruction expressed in natural language), and the target video.
Based on the relationships among these elements, we evaluate the target video along three dimensions: 1)
Video Quality focuses on the quality of the target video itself; 2) Instruction Compliance focuses on the
4


## Page 5


alignment between the edit prompt and the target video; 3) Fidelity focuses on the consistency between the
source video and the target video. Notably, the dimensions of Video Quality and Instruction Compliance are
also applicable as evaluation criteria in video generation tasks, whereas Fidelity is a dimension specific to
video editing.
4.1
Video Quality
Since a video is essentially composed of a sequence of image frames arranged in chronological order, video
quality can be subdivided into two aspects: temporal quality and spatial quality. Temporal quality focuses on
the consistency and continuity between consecutive video frames, while spatial quality emphasizes aspects
such as aesthetic value, image sharpness and the naturalness of the content.
Subject Consistency (SC).
For the subjects in a video, we assess whether their appearance remains consistent throughout the sequence by
computing the cross-frame similarity of DINO [4] feature, which serves to evaluate different models’ capability
in maintaining subject consistency.
Background Consistency (BC). For the video’s overall background, we evaluate the temporal consistency of
the background scene by computing the cross-frame similarity of the CLIP [29] feature.
Temporal Flickering (TF). We observe that videos produced by many editing models exhibit temporal
flickering. Accordingly, we quantify temporal flicker by sampling frames and computing the mean absolute
difference across frames.
Motion Smoothness (MS). Motion smoothness is utilized to evaluate the continuity and naturalness of
subject or camera movements. Under normal circumstances, a video should be free from jitter and unnatural
acceleration variations. We adopt the motion priors from the video frame interpolation model [23] to assess
the smoothness of motion in the edited videos.
Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS)
[39] is the output of a supervised model trained on human-
annotated data. It integrates indicators such as compositional coherence, aesthetic quality, image sharpness,
color saturation, content naturalness, and motion stability, thereby enabling a comprehensive assessment of a
video’s spatial quality.
4.2
Instruction Compliance
Instruction compliance is used to evaluate whether the generated target video correctly fulfills the requirements
specified in the editing prompt, and whether it is semantically aligned with the target prompt. In addition to
general metrics and task-specific criteria for different editing tasks, we further employ MLLM to assist in
assessing the semantic consistency between the video content and the editing instructions, thereby enhancing
the comprehensiveness and objectivity of the evaluation.
Overall Semantic Consistency (OSC). Global semantic consistency is used to holistically evaluate the
semantic correspondence between the target video’s content and the instruction’s intent, with an emphasis on
the overall scene. Therefore, we employ VideoCLIP-XL2 [37] to compute the semantic similarity between the
target video and the target prompt.
Phrase Semantic Consistency (PSC). Phrase-level editing adherence is used to assess whether the specific
phrases or operations in the instruction are accurately reflected in the target video, with greater emphasis on
the edited subject. Accordingly, we employ VideoCLIP-XL2 [37] to compute the semantic similarity between
the target video and the target phrase.
Instruction Satisfaction (IS). Since tasks such as subject motion editing, camera motion editing and camera
angle editing are difficult to evaluate accurately using traditional methods, we employ Qwen2.5-VL [2] to
assist in determining whether the target video has faithfully executed the edit prompt. Specifically, we input
both the edit prompt and the target video into the model, instructing it to assign a score on a five-point scale
to indicate the accuracy of execution. Furthermore, we provide detailed descriptions for each score level to
ensure that the model maintains consistent evaluation criteria across multiple rounds of assessment.

Quantity Accuracy (QA). Quantity correctness is a metric specifically designed for quality editing tasks. This
metric uses the target span as input to Grounding DINO [26], compares the number of detected bounding
boxes with the quantity specified in the edit prompt, and assigns a score of 1 for correctness and 0 for
incorrectness.
4.3
Video Fidelity
Fidelity is utilized to assess whether the target video retains the unedited portions of the source video, thereby
ensuring that the editing process does not introduce irrelevant alterations. In addition to devising conventional
metrics from the perspectives of motion and semantics, we further leverage MLLM to assess the content
fidelity of the target video, enhancing the robustness of the metric on more challenging tasks.
Semantic Fidelity (SF). To quantify the degree of semantic preservation in the target video, we employ
VideoCLIP-XL2 [37] to compute the feature similarity between the source and target videos.
Motion Fidelity (MF).
Existing video motion detection often relies on optical flow, but it struggles with occlusions. Therefore, we
employ Cotracker3 [16], which is capable of handling occlusions, for extracting reliable motion trajectories.
The details of the trajectory similarity computation are provided in Sec. B.
Content Fidelity (CF). For tasks such as camera movement editing, camera angle editing and transition
editing, the same subject may display different orientations due to variations in perspective, which makes it
difficult for traditional metrics to adequately capture content preservation. To address this limitation, we use
Qwen2.5-VL [2] to assist in evaluating whether the target video correctly retains those elements that should
remain unedited. Specifically, we input the source prompt, the edit prompt, and the target video into the
model, instructing it to assign a score on a five-point scale reflecting the fidelity of the unedited content. In
addition, we provide detailed descriptions for each score level to ensure that the model adheres to consistent
evaluation standards across multiple rounds of assessment.
Among these 12 metrics, SC, BC, TF, and MS are adopted from VBench [11]. We conducted independence
tests on the remaining 8 metrics (detailed in Sec. G), demonstrating that the IVEBench metrics exhibit a
high degree of independence.
4.4
Human Alignment for Benchmark Validation
We select three video editing models {A, B, C} and provide 30 source videos with corresponding editing
instructions. For a given source video vi and its editing instruction pi, each selected video editing model
produces an edited video, resulting in a set Gi = {Vi,A, Vi,B, Vi,C}. Within each set, the generated videos are
compared in pairs, yielding C2
3 = 3 pairwise comparisons. For each evaluation dimension, we prepare detailed
guidelines and illustrative examples, and participants receive prior training to ensure a clear understanding of
the dimension definitions. In every pairwise comparison, human annotators are instructed to evaluate the
videos exclusively with respect to the specified metric (see Fig. 4), and to subjectively judge which video
performs better in that dimension, or to mark the pair as "hard to distinguish." We recruit 30 participants to
conduct the human annotation. The conclusions of this experiment will be presented in Sec. 6.2, with further
details provided in Sec. F.

Unified Scoring for Benchmark Assessment
Each evaluation dimension comprises multiple metrics. To assess their relative importance, trained annotators
rate the contribution of each metric and dimension. The average ratings are rounded to the nearest integer
and used as weights in the scoring formulas. Detailed formulas for dimensions and total score are provided
in Sec. C.

Discussion with Recent Video Editing Benchmarks
Existing video editing benchmarks are primarily designed for source-target prompt-based methods, and they
either fail to support or can only minimally accommodate IVE methods [21]. As summarized in Tab. 1,
these benchmarks exhibit clear limitations in dataset scale and coverage. More critically, their prompt design
largely remains confined to image editing types (subject editing, attribute editing, or style editing) without
dedicated task formulations that address the temporal nature of video. In contrast, IVEBench provides a
comprehensive and instruction-centered evaluation suite that introduces three substantial advances: 1) A
large-scale dataset of 600 videos, covering 35 topics across 7 dimensions, with lengths ranging from 32 to
1024 frames, organized into short and long subsets to enhance source diversity and semantic coverage. 2)
Full coverage of eight major categories and thirty-five subcategories of editing tasks, including those that
explicitly leverage the unique properties of video, spanning different levels of granularity as well as tasks
involving both single and multiple subjects. 3) MLLM-based metrics specifically designed for Instruction

Quantitative analysis.
From the numerical results
in Tab. 2 and Tab. 3 as well as the visualizations
in Fig. 4, it can be observed that eight evalu-
ated methods demonstrate relatively good frame-to-
frame consistency. However, the per-frame image
quality remains unsatisfactory, which consequently
leads to low Video Fidelity scores. Moreover, these
methods achieve very limited performance in in-
struction adherence, primarily due to the narrow
range of task types they support. Among them,
Lucy-Edit-Dev [36] exhibits the best performance
in editing speed. Ditto [1] and InsV2V [7] demon-
strate the best performance in terms of editing
capability, as they can execute editing prompts
while preserving visual integrity.
Furthermore,
since Ditto successfully handles a larger number
of cases, it achieves the best performance in In-
struction Compliance. Nevertheless, these models
achieve a Total Score of no more than 0.7 and an
Instruction Compliance score of no more than 0.5, indicating that existing IVE methods still have substantial
room for improvement in overall editing capability, particularly in Instruction Compliance.

Figure 5 Qualitative comparison of selected IVE methods.
Qualitative analysis.
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the outputs of different models reveal consistent weaknesses
across multiple editing scenarios. First, all models tend to introduce inaccurate localization of the desired edit,
leading to visible artifacts such as geometric distortion, semantic bleeding, semantic collapsing, boundary
blurring, and texture flickering. These artifacts significantly compromise the per-frame visual quality of edited
videos, which in turn diminishes their overall fidelity. Second, when observing more challenging editing types,
such as subject motion editing and camera angle editing, we find that the editing capability of current models
is particularly limited, underscoring an urgent need for broader task coverage in future development. Moreover,
the models show distinct behavioral patterns: StableV2V [25] often applies overly aggressive modifications
that satisfy the editing prompt but neglect the preservation of unedited content; InsV2V [7], in contrast,
tends to adopt a conservative strategy, retaining much of the source content when dealing with unfamiliar
instructions; while VACE [14], not being a native IVE model, frequently fails to properly execute the given
edits, resulting in weak compliance with the prompts. These qualitative findings highlight that improving
per-frame image fidelity and expanding editing versatility are essential directions for advancing IVE models.
More detailed qualitative comparisons and analyses can be found in Sec. E.

Human alignment results.
To validate that our evaluation metrics align with human perception, as described
in Sec. 4.4, we conduct human annotations for each metric. In pairwise model comparisons, the preferred
model is assigned a score of 1, while the other receives 0. If annotators express no preference, both models
are assigned 0.5. For each metric, a model’s final human score is computed as the total score divided by
the number of comparisons. We then calculate Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between these human
scores and the automatic evaluation metric scores. The results in Tab. 4 demonstrate that our proposed
evaluation metrics exhibit a high degree of consistency with human preferences. Furthermore, to ensure the
inter-rater reliability of the evaluation, we calculated Fleiss’ Kappa for our human annotations and obtained a
score of 0.78, which indicates ’substantial agreement’ according to Landis and Koch [19]. This demonstrates
that our rigorous calibration process effectively aligned the standards of different annotators.

Insights and discussions
High frame-to-frame consistency, weak single-frame quality. Across models, frame-to-frame consistency
is generally well preserved, with limited temporal flickering. However, the quality of individual frames often
shows frequent visible artifacts such as semantic bleeding, boundary blurring and texture flickering. These
issues also lead to a noticeable degradation in Video Fidelity, highlighting the necessity for future work to
develop effective strategies to mitigate such artifacts.
Limited support for diverse editing prompt types. Models perform poorly in the Compliance dimension
mainly because they only handle a few basic editing types reasonably well, namely subject editing, style
editing and attribution editing. In contrast, they lack the capacity to execute more advanced editing types
such as quantity editing, subject motion editing, visual effect editing, camera motion editing and camera
angle editing. This leads to consistently low scores across all compliance-related metrics. Future video editing
models should therefore place greater emphasis on broadening the range of supported editing prompts.
Intrinsic limitations of first-frame-based editing models. Video editing, unlike image editing, requires
maintaining temporal coherence, which introduces the need to modify middle or later frames of a video. For
example, to handle transitions or to insert intermediate events. These tasks do not originate from modifications
in the initial frames but instead focus on transformations that occur later in the sequence. First-frame-based
models, however, propagate changes from the beginning throughout the entire video, making them inadequate
for such editing requirements.
Scalability to long video sequences. A critical challenge in IVE lies in handling long sequences with
hundreds or even thousands of frames. Most existing methods, especially those relying on frame-wise diffusion
or first-frame propagation, exhibit a near-linear growth in GPU memory consumption and latency as sequence
length increases, making them impractical for videos beyond 128 frames. In contrast, InsV2V [7] demonstrates
superior scalability by adopting a chunked inference strategy with latent overlap, where only a limited set
of reference frames is preserved across segments. This design effectively constrains memory growth while
maintaining temporal continuity.
Resolution limitations. Existing IVE methods, typically operate at 512×512 or 832×480 resolution, which
is far below the standard of real-world user content. The multi-conditional video editing model VACE [14]
can support 720P outputs; however, this still falls short of the practical demand, as user videos are commonly
recorded in 1080P or higher resolutions, and the expectation is that edited outputs should preserve this level
of detail. The low-resolution setting limits visual fidelity, which results in artifacts such as blurred textures
and edge degradation, and also reduces usability in professional media workflows.

Conclusion
With the rapid progress of IVE, how to systematically and comprehensively evaluate these methods has
become a central challenge in the field. Existing benchmarks exhibit clear limitations in terms of video
source diversity, task coverage, and evaluation dimensions, making them insufficient to reliably reflect the true
capabilities of current approaches or to provide meaningful guidance for subsequent research. To address these
issues, we propose IVEBench, a modern benchmarking suite designed for IVE models. IVEBench integrates a
large-scale and diverse dataset, a broad range of editing tasks, and a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol
that leverages MLLMs and aligns closely with human perception. We expect IVEBench to play a key role in
the evaluation of video editing models and in advancing the development of the field.
Limitation and future work. As more IVE models are released as open source, we plan to incorporate them
into IVEBench for further benchmarking and comparison. In the future, with the increase of computational
power, we will also expand the scale of data used for evaluation.

Motion Fidelity Computation Details
We describe the computation of motion fidelity between a source video and a target video. Given a video
sequence, we sample query points on a uniform grid of size g. For each query point p, CoTracker3 [16] outputs
a trajectory xp = (xp
1, xp
2, . . . , xp
T ) with xp
t ∈R2, together with a visibility vector vp = (vp
1, vp
2, . . . , vp
T ) where
vp
t ∈[0, 1] indicates whether p is visible at frame t. To compare two videos of different lengths, all trajectories
are interpolated to a synchronized length T = min(T1, T2) using linear interpolation based on visible frames.
Given two synchronized tracks (˜xp, ˜vp) and (˜yq, ˜wq), we compute the frame-wise position distance
dpos
t
= ∥˜xp
t −˜yq
t ∥2,
and velocity distance
dvel
t
= ∥(˜xp
t −˜xp
t−1) −(˜yq
t −˜yq
t−1)∥2
for t > 1,
with dvel

with α ≥10−6. We then define normalized distances ˆdpos
t

t
= dvel
t /α and convert them into
similarities spos
t
= 1/(1 + ˆdpos
t
), svel
t
= 1/(1 + ˆdvel
t ). The frame-wise similarity is obtained by weighted
combination
st = 0.7spos
t
+ 0.3svel
t ,
and further weighted by visibility wt = min(˜vp
t , ˜wq
t ). The overall track similarity is
S(p, q) =


PT
t=1 stwt
PT

if P
t wt > 0,
0,
otherwise.
Let N1 and N2 be the numbers of valid tracks in the source and target videos. We construct a similarity
matrix M ∈RN1×N2 with Mij = S(pi, qj). To establish correspondence, we apply the Hungarian algorithm
to maximize P
i Mi,π(i) with one-to-one mapping π. We discard pairs with Mi,π(i) ≤0.3 and compute the
final motion fidelity between videos V1 and V2 as
MF(V1, V2) =
1
|P|
X
i∈P
Mi,π(i),
16

where P = {i | Mi,π(i) > 0.3} is the set of valid correspondences. Finally, given K video pairs, the dataset-level
motion fidelity score is
MF = 1

t

are frame-wise distances, st ∈[0, 1] is the frame-wise similarity, S(p, q) is the similarity
of two tracks, Mij the similarity matrix, and π the matching permutation given by the Hungarian algorithm.

Unified Scoring Formulation and Details
For a given evaluation dimension D, let the set of metrics be {m1, m2, . . . , mnD} with corresponding weights
{w1, w2, . . . , wnD}. The score for dimension D is defined as:
SD =
PnD
i=1 wi · mi
PnD
i=1 wi
.
In our study, the three dimensions are computed as:
Video Quality =
P
i∈V wi · mi
P
i∈V wi
,
Instruction Compliance =
P
i∈I wi · mi
P
i∈I wi
,
Video Fidelity =
P
i∈F wi · mi
P
i∈F wi
.
where V, I, and F denote the sets of metrics belonging to Video Quality, Instruction Compliance, and Video
Fidelity, respectively. The overall score is obtained by treating the three dimension scores as higher-level
metrics. Let the set of dimensions be D, with scores {Sj} and corresponding weights {αj}. The total score is
given by:
Total Score =
P
j∈D αj · Sj
P
j∈D αj
.
Both metric-level weights wi and dimension-level weights αj are determined from the user study: each
participant provided importance ratings (0-5) for metrics and dimensions. The ratings were averaged across
participants, rounded to the nearest integer, and applied directly in the above formulas. According to the
participants’ ratings, the weight of VTSS is 5, the weights of IS and CF are 3, while the weights of other
metrics are 1. Since the weights of the three dimensions are all 4, they are normalized to 1. The resulting
scores for different models are reported in Tab. 2.

Experiment Details
All experiments were performed on NVIDIA H20 GPUs: InsV2V, AnyV2V, and StableV2V were run on a
single GPU, while VACE required two GPUs for 720P inputs. Each model’s output video resolution followed its
officially recommended setting, and the number of generated frames was matched to the input sequence. When
certain videos could not be processed due to out-of-memory errors, the corresponding results were excluded,
and the indices of these failed videos are provided in Tab. A2. Moreover, due to VACE’s fixed maximum frame
limit of 81 frames [14], source videos exceeding this length were uniformly sampled to 81 frames specifically
for VACE editing. The maximum frame count for ICVE [24] is set to the officially recommended 81 frames,
as exceeding this limit results in excessive GPU memory usage. Similarly, Omni-Video [35] is configured
with a maximum of 17 frames to prevent output noise, while Ditto [1] is set to the officially recommended 73
frames. Both short and long subsets of the IVEBench Database were used to assess editing capability across
17

video lengths. For each model and subset, we also recorded the average runtime per frame and the peak
GPU memory consumption. Evaluation was carried out using the twelve indicators of IVEBench Metrics,
organized into three dimensions, where indicator scores were first computed per task, then averaged across
videos, with irrelevant indicators omitted depending on the editing type; finally, all scores were normalized
before visualization.

Figure A1 Visualization of Model Output Comparison. We concatenate the first, middle, and last frames of the
video to facilitate comparison of the temporal performance across different models.
In this section, we provide a more detailed quantitative comparison of the evaluated models across different
categories of instruction-guided video editing. While the main results are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 4
of the main paper, here we extend the analysis to highlight model behaviors under specific editing tasks and
19


## Page 20


frame lengths. We further complement the numerical results with Fig. A1, which illustrates representative
editing scenarios by concatenating the first, middle, and last frames of each generated video. This visualization
helps reveal temporal dynamics and qualitative differences that may not always be fully captured by scalar
metrics.
Specifically, InsV2V demonstrates relatively balanced performance across most categories, maintaining higher
semantic fidelity and motion fidelity even in longer sequences. However, its conservative strategy sometimes
leads to under-editing, resulting in lower scores in instruction satisfaction. AnyV2V exhibits strong Instruction
Compliance in simpler style and attribute editing tasks, yet struggles under difficult editing tasks. The
aggressive editing strategy of stableV2V leads to a higher instruction satisfaction score, but visual inspections
clearly show severe semantic bleeding and boundary artifacts when dealing with complex prompts. Finally,
VACE, though not originally designed for IVE, achieves reasonable temporal smoothness and high resolution
outputs; nevertheless, its restricted maximum frame length limits its applicability, and its overall performance
in instruction compliance remains unsatisfactory compared to native IVE models.
Taken together, these detailed results and the examples in
Fig. A1 confirm that current models, while
capable of maintaining frame-to-frame coherence, still fall short in faithfully executing diverse instructions
and preserving high per-frame fidelity. This underscores the necessity of IVEBench in identifying fine-grained
weaknesses and providing clear guidance for future methodological improvements.

Human Alignment Details
Figure A2 Human Annotation Interface for Benchmark Validation. The interface presents the source video, the
editing instruction, and the outputs of different models under a specified evaluation dimension, enabling annotators to
conduct pairwise comparisons and judge which video better satisfies the given criterion.
To validate the alignment of IVEBench metrics, we first provided each annotator with a detailed explanation
of the meaning of each metric along with illustrative examples of good and poor cases, followed by additional
case-based tests to ensure that the annotators fully understood the intended interpretation of the metric.
Moreover, we conducted further tests to confirm that the annotators focused exclusively on the designated
metric during comparisons, rather than being influenced by the overall quality of the videos. For ease of
experimentation, we designed a dedicated annotation interface for human evaluators. The interface displays
the source video, editing instruction, and the outputs of different models for direct comparison under a
specified evaluation dimension. Annotators are instructed to make pairwise comparisons between outputs,
choosing the video that better satisfies the designated metric or marking them as indistinguishable when
necessary. The design of the interface is illustrated in Fig. A2.
G
Independence of Metrics
Metric independence is crucial for a benchmark, as it helps avoid redundancy and better reveals the trade-offs
among the evaluated models. To quantitatively verify the independence of the 8 metrics proposed in IVEBench
21


## Page 22


(distinct from SC, BC, TF, and MS, which are adopted from VBench [11]), we calculated the Spearman
correlation coefficient matrix across the results of all models, as shown in Fig. A3. The results demonstrate
that the Spearman correlation coefficients among all metrics do not exceed 0.65. This indicates the absence of
collinearity [9], supporting the independence and distinctiveness of our metric design. Additionally, negative
correlations observed among several metrics suggest that IVEBench metrics can effectively reveal the trade-offs
within the evaluated models.
